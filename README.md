### And then?
So this is what needs to be done:

**HTML**
* Create a template (places-list) who shows all the cofffeespots.
* Create a template (places-list--item) which contains a single coffeespot.

**CSS**
* create a matching places-list.scss and style the list
* create a places-list--item.scss and style a single item

**JS**
* Get data from the FourSquere API, for Amsterdam
* Create a matching places-list.js and render all the data

#### Later
* Make a form to send your Location
* Send your Location via GPS or something like that
